If you are a fan of Asterix and Obelix comics, you might want to try out their video game adaptation, Asterix and Obelix XXL 2: Mission Las Vegum. This is an action-adventure game that parodies many classic games and characters, such as Mario, Sonic, Lara Croft, and more. You can play as either Asterix or Obelix, or switch between them at any time, and use their unique abilities to fight against the Roman army and rescue their druid friend Getafix.
  
The game was originally released in 2005 for Windows and PlayStation 2, but it was remastered in 2018 for PS4, PC, XB1, and Nintendo Switch. The remaster features enhanced graphics, new collectibles, challenges, shops, upgrades, and costumes. However, if you want to play the original version of the game on your PC, you might need a crack to bypass the copy protection.

A crack is a modified version of the game's executable file that allows you to run the game without inserting the original CD or DVD. There are many websites that offer cracks for various games, but you should be careful when downloading them, as some of them might contain viruses or malware. You should also check the compatibility of the crack with your system and the game version.
  
One of the websites that claims to have a working crack for Asterix and Obelix XXL 2: Mission Las Vegum is My Abandonware[^1^]. This is a website that hosts old games that are no longer sold or supported by their developers or publishers. You can download the game from there for free, along with the crack file. However, you should scan the files with an antivirus program before running them.
  
To install the game and the crack, follow these steps:
  
1. Download the game from My Abandonware[^1^] and extract it with a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip.
2. Mount the ISO file with a program like Daemon Tools or Virtual CloneDrive.
3. Run the setup.exe file and follow the instructions to install the game.
4. Download the crack file from My Abandonware[^1^] and extract it.
5. Copy the crack file (AsterixXXL2.exe) and paste it into the game's installation folder (usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Atari\Asterix & Obelix XXL 2).
6. Replace the original file when prompted.
7. Run the game from the crack file (AsterixXXL2.exe) and enjoy!

Note that this method might not work for everyone, as some users have reported issues with running the game on newer systems. If you encounter any problems, you might want to try some of these solutions:

- Run the game in compatibility mode for Windows XP SP3.
- Run the game as an administrator.
- Update your graphics card drivers.
- Disable any antivirus or firewall programs that might interfere with the game.
- Change your screen resolution to match the game's resolution (800x600).

If none of these solutions work for you, you might want to consider buying the remastered version of the game from Steam, which is more compatible with modern systems and has more features. Alternatively, you can also play the game on an emulator like PCSX2 or RPCS3 if you have a PlayStation 2 or PlayStation 3 copy of the game.
  
Asterix and Obelix XXL 2: Mission Las Vegum is a fun and humorous game that will appeal to fans of the comics and gamers alike. Whether you choose to play the original or the remastered version, you will have a blast exploring Las Vegum and fighting against Caesar's legionaries. Just make sure you download and install the game safely and legally.
