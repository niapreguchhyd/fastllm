Once you have installed MEP Modeler for Archicad 16, you can start creating and editing MEP networks in your Archicad projects. Here are some tips to help you get started:

- To create a new MEP network, go to Design > MEP Modeling > Create MEP Network. You can choose from predefined MEP systems (such as HVAC, Plumbing, Electrical, etc.) or create a custom one. You can also assign a name and a color to your MEP network.
- To add MEP elements to your network, go to Design > MEP Modeling > Place MEP Element. You can choose from various types of elements (such as ducts, pipes, cables, fittings, terminals, etc.) and adjust their parameters (such as size, shape, orientation, connection type, etc.) in the Info Box or the MEP Settings dialog.
- To edit an existing MEP element, select it and use the Pet Palette or the Edit > MEP Modeling submenu. You can move, rotate, stretch, split, merge, or delete MEP elements. You can also use the Edit > Reshape > Align or Distribute commands to align or distribute multiple elements.
- To check the collision between MEP elements and other Archicad elements (such as walls, slabs, roofs, etc.), go to Design > MEP Modeling > Collision Detection. You can specify the collision tolerance and the elements to be checked. The detected collisions will be highlighted in red in the 3D window.
- To generate documentation for your MEP networks, go to Document > Documenting Tools > Schedules & Lists > MEP Systems. You can create schedules and lists of MEP elements and their properties. You can also export them to Excel or other formats.
