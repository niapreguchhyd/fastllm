Have you ever encountered a situation where you need to get the numerical data from a graph, plot or map image, but you don't have the original data file? Maybe you want to reproduce a scientific result, analyze a historical trend or compare different sources of information. If so, you might be interested in using GetData Graph Digitizer, a software tool that can help you digitize images and extract the data points.
 
GetData Graph Digitizer is a program that allows you to manually or automatically trace lines from graphs, plots and maps. It supports various image formats, such as TIFF, JPEG, BMP and PCX. It also lets you adjust the axes, colors and scale of the image, as well as erase unwanted data or undo any changes. You can export the digitized data as text, Excel or XML files.

However, GetData Graph Digitizer is not a free software. It costs $30 for a single user license. If you don't want to pay for it, you might be tempted to look for a crack version online. A crack version is a modified version of the software that bypasses the license verification process and allows you to use it without paying. However, using a crack version is illegal and risky. You might end up downloading malware or viruses that can harm your computer or compromise your personal information.
 
Therefore, we do not recommend using a crack version of GetData Graph Digitizer 2.26 or any other version. Instead, we suggest you to use the free trial version of the software that is available on the official website: [https://en.freedownloadmanager.org/Windows-PC/GetData-Graph-Digitizer.html](https://en.freedownloadmanager.org/Windows-PC/GetData-Graph-Digitizer.html). The trial version allows you to use all the features of the software for 21 days. After that, you can decide whether to buy the license or not.

To use GetData Graph Digitizer, you need to follow these four steps:
 
1. Open the image file that contains the graph, plot or map that you want to digitize.
2. Set the scale and orientation of the Cartesian coordinate system on the image.
3. Choose the digitization method: manual or automatic. Manual digitization requires you to click on each data point on the image. Automatic digitization uses an algorithm to detect and trace the lines on the image.
4. Export the digitized data as a text, Excel or XML file.

We hope this article has helped you understand how to use GetData Graph Digitizer to extract data from images. If you have any questions or feedback, please leave a comment below.
  
GetData Graph Digitizer is not the only software tool that can digitize images and extract data. There are other alternatives that you can try, such as WebPlotDigitizer, Engauge Digitizer and Plot Digitizer. These tools are free and open source, which means you can use them without paying or breaking any laws. However, they may have different features, interfaces and performance than GetData Graph Digitizer. You can compare them and see which one suits your needs better.
 
Another option is to use online services that can digitize images and extract data for you. For example, you can use DataThief, a web-based tool that allows you to upload an image and get the data points as a text file. You can also use ImageJ, a Java-based image processing program that has a plugin called Plot Digitizer that can digitize images and export data. These online services are convenient and easy to use, but they may have limitations on the file size, format and quality of the images that they can handle.
 
Finally, you can also try to contact the original source of the image and ask for the data file. This might be the best way to get the most accurate and reliable data, especially if the image is from a scientific publication or a reputable organization. However, this might not always be possible or feasible, depending on the availability and willingness of the source to share the data.
