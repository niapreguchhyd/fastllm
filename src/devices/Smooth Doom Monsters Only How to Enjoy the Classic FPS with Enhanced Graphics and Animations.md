# How to Enjoy Smooth Doom Monsters Only Mods
 
Smooth Doom is a popular mod for the classic first-person shooter game Doom that enhances the graphics and animations of the original game. Smooth Doom adds more frames, smoother movements, dynamic lights, and other effects to make the game look more modern and realistic.
 
However, some players may prefer to keep the original gameplay and weapons of Doom, and only enjoy the improved visuals of the enemies. For those players, there are several mods that offer Smooth Doom monsters only, without changing anything else in the game. These mods replace all the original enemies of Doom with those of the Smooth Doom version, making them more detailed and varied.

Smooth Doom monsters only mods are not only aesthetically pleasing, but also offer some gameplay advantages. For example, some enemies have more varied attacks and behaviors, such as the Imps throwing faster fireballs, the Cacodemons spitting acid blood when hurt, or the Cyberdemon firing rockets in bursts. These changes make the enemies more challenging and unpredictable, requiring the player to adapt their strategies and tactics.
 
Another benefit of Smooth Doom monsters only mods is that they are compatible with most other Doom mods that do not alter the enemies. This means that the player can mix and match different mods to customize their Doom experience. For instance, the player can use Smooth Doom monsters only with mods that add new weapons, maps, music, sound effects, or gameplay features. The possibilities are endless.
 
Smooth Doom monsters only mods are a great way to enjoy Doom in a new light. They enhance the graphics and animations of the enemies without changing the core gameplay and feel of the original game. They also add some variety and challenge to the combat, making it more fun and engaging. If you are a fan of Doom and want to try something different, you should give these mods a try.
