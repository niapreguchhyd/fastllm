# Deep Forest: A Journey Through World Music in High Quality FLAC Format
 
If you are a fan of world music, ambient sounds, and ethereal vocals, you might have heard of Deep Forest, a French musical group that combines these elements in their albums. Deep Forest was formed in 1992 by Eric Mouquet and Michel Sanchez, who were inspired by the music of various indigenous cultures around the world. They blended traditional songs and chants with modern electronic beats and synthesizers, creating a unique sound that was both exotic and familiar.
 
Deep Forest released seven studio albums between 1992 and 2004, each one exploring a different theme and region of the world. Their debut album, Deep Forest, featured samples from the Pygmy people of Central Africa, and was a huge success, selling over three million copies and winning a Grammy Award for Best World Music Album. Their second album, Boheme, focused on Eastern Europe, especially Romania and Hungary, and featured the vocals of Marta Sebestyen. Their third album, Comparsa, took them to Latin America, where they collaborated with artists from Brazil, Cuba, Mexico, and Peru. Their fourth album, Music Detected, was a departure from their previous style, incorporating more rock and pop influences and featuring guest singers like Beverly Jo Scott and Chitose Hajime. Their fifth album, Pacifique, was a soundtrack for the French film Le Peuple Migrateur (Winged Migration), and included sounds from various birds and animals. Their sixth album, Essence of the Forest, was a compilation of their best songs from their previous albums, as well as some remixes and unreleased tracks. Their seventh and final album, Kusa No Ran (Rebellion of the Grass), was a collaboration with Japanese composer Ryuichi Sakamoto, and was inspired by the ancient legends of Japan.
