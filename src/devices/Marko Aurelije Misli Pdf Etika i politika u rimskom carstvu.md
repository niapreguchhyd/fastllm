## What is Stoicism?
 
Stoicism is a branch of ancient Greek philosophy that was founded by Zeno of Citium in the 3rd century BC. It was later developed by other famous thinkers such as Seneca, Epictetus and Marko Aurelije. Stoicism teaches that the only thing we can control is our own judgments, actions and reactions, and that we should focus on them instead of worrying about external events that are beyond our control. Stoicism also teaches that we should live according to our rational nature, which is aligned with the universal reason or logos that governs the cosmos. By doing so, we can achieve inner peace, happiness and freedom.
